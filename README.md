Building the basics of a platformer style game.

## Godot
Built using the Godot Game Engine[https://godotengine.org/]

## Rust
Rust bindings provided by the gdext[https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext] project

This is a work-in-progress and constantly evolving. Hopefully it can be used as a reference of some sort for new-comers to gdext, and maybe even Godot (if, like me, you jump right into gdext without Godot knowledge).
